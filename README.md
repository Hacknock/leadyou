CON_LIMIT=5
WEB_PORT=3000
```

### Test

We prepare the test code to check the connection between the app and MariaDB. Please run the following command.

```sh
sudo docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f ./docker/test.yml up --build --abort-on-container-exit
```

### Deploy

Please run the following command on the top-level directory of this repository.

**Run with log output**

```sh
sudo docker-compose up --build
```

Please type `ctrl+c` if you close docker.

**Run without log output (daemon)**

Please execute the following command if you run LEADYOU in daemon mode.

```sh
sudo docker-compose up --build -d
```

Please execute the following command if you want to stop LEADYOU.

```sh
sudo docker-compose stop
```

**Run without log output and keep storage on host OS**
This mode enables to keep storage which includes issued README data. This data is used for displaying the README catalogs on the top page.

```sh
sudo docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f ./docker/production.yml up --build -d
```

```sh
sudo docker-compose stop

**How to access LEADYOU after deployment**

After deployment, you access `http://localhost:[Port number you set]`.
You should be able to access LEADYOU on your local PC.

### Call LEADYOU API

We provide APIs enable you to check LEADYOU's behavior.

**Show table of generated READMEs.**

This API gives a list of information about README which was generated with LEADYOU on your local environment.

```
http://localhost:[Port number you set]/showGeneratedTable?limit=10&token=[LEADYOU_API_TOKEN]
```

- `limit` is the number of records to show.
- `token` is the environment variable you set in the `.env` file.

**Update catalog states**

This API updates state (used/not used) of READMEs which were generated with LEADYOU on your local environment.
Based on this information, the top page of LEADYOU displays a catalog listing the actual READMEs in use.

```
http://localhost:[Port number you set]/updateCatalog?limit=3&token=[LEADYOU_API_TOKEN]
```

- `limit` is the number of records to update status (counted from the most recent).
- `token` is the environment variable you set in the `.env` file.

# Minimal Example

You can add or delete some items to make README using this repository source code.
For example, you want to add "Support".
This item will help your colleagues ask you when they will face a problem with using your software.
You add the following code on lines 178 to 191 of `/app/public/public/plugins/template.json`.

```json
{
  "title": "Support",
  "hiddenTitle": false,
  "required": false,
  "replacement": false,
  "multiple": true,
  "component": "wrap-oneline-field",
  "description": "Please input the contact information when the user faces some problem on using your software.",
  "kindsOfValues": ["plain"],
  "formats": ["- %s\n"],
  "attributes": {
    "placeholder": "[Name](URL)"
  }
}
```

You deploy it again, Support item will be on edit form like this screenshot. üçª
