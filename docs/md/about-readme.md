# About README

## What is README?

A README is like a specification that a developer refers to when using the open source or library you created.

> You can add a README file to your repository to tell other people why your project is useful, what they can do with your project, and how they can use it.
> (Quote it from [About READMEs](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/about-readmes) written by Github.com)

As Github says, the README can be used to show the usefulness of your project, what it can do, and how to use it.
Github states that the following five are generally included:

- What the project does
- Why the project is useful
- How users can get started with the project
- Where users can get help with your project
- Who maintains and contributes to the project

## Why is README important?

The README is the first document other developers will read when they access your project.
When you first access the repository, you'll want to know why it's useful, what it can do, and how to use it.
Especially when comparing two projects that can do the same thing, or when you're looking for an affordable and easy-to-use package, it's best to read the README and make an instant decision on whether to adopt it or not for your project. That is clear.
What's more, you can do the same thing, but not on all platforms, so you want to know instantly if the repository you find is the right open source or project for your situation.
As such, the README of each repository is important for comparing multiple open sources, whether to adopt to your project open source such as packages, libraries, frameworks, etc.

## What are current problems?

Almost current project READMEs not only don't include the five elements mentioned in "What is README?", but also the usefulness of what the project solves for a currently unrealized problem, what features it provides, and how it can be used. It does not say that you should use it.
This makes it difficult for you to decide if you should use that open source or not, and it also makes it difficult to compare it to other open sources.
As you've experienced, in many cases, we are aware of the existence of new open source through question sites like Stack Overflow or technical conferences, or websites its developers, or I guess that you are aware of them through papers and other sources.
In any case, you should seek out, read, and compare sources other than READMEs to find out how useful open source is that you have found. Conversely, if you want to publish and promote innovative open source in the future, you will need additional resources and costs, such as creating and publishing a site for the project.
We think it's a very important issue for developers to be able to create and share new open source with their own ideas at any time, and to be able to publish and view that information with minimal effort, while it's available to everyone.

## Our proposed readme contents

The README.md content we propose is based on content that should be included in papers as a way of sharing knowledge.
In this issue, we're proposing content to be included in README.md based on the most common content in engineering and information papers, especially considering that many of the papers on Github are in the technical field.

### Proposed Contents

1. Project Name（Required）
2. Badges
3. Tags（Required）
4. Short Discription（Required）
5. Demo
6. Advantages（Required）
7. Installation（Required）
8. Deployment
9. Minimal Example（Required）
10. Contributors（Required）
11. Users

### You can contribute this format

At the time of writing this document, the suggestions which was written by LEADYOU developers have been adopted, but you can suggest a new README.md format for LEADYOU.
